Abstract
Large language models (LLMs) are now be-
ing considered and even deployed for ap-
plications that support high-stakes decision-
making, such as recruitment and clinical de-
cisions. While several methods have been
proposed for measuring bias, there remains a
gap between predictions , which are what the
proposed methods consider, and how they
are used to make decisions . In this work, we
introduce Rank-Allocational-Based Bias In-
dex(RABBI), a model-agnostic bias measure
that assesses potential allocational harms
arising from biases in LLM predictions. We
compare RABBI and current bias metrics on
two allocation decision tasks. We evaluate
their predictive validity across ten LLMs and
utility for model selection. Our results re-
veal that commonly-used bias metrics based
on average performance gap and distribution
distance fail to reliably capture group dispari-
ties in allocation outcomes, whereas RABBI
exhibits a strong correlation with allocation
disparities. Our work highlights the need to
account for how models are used in contexts
with limited resource constraints.
1 Introduction
The growing popularity of large language models
(LLMs) has raised concerns regarding the poten-
tial for discrimination and harm if they are used in
high-stake decision-making contexts, such as lend-
ing decisions in financial sectors (Fu et al., 2021),
hiring (Bogen and Rieke, 2018), and healthcare
triage (Rajkomar et al., 2018). Recent orders in
both Europe (European Parliament, 2024) and the
United States (Biden, 2023) have mandated audits
to address AI risks including bias, but left it unclear
how to conduct effective audits.
Several methods have been proposed to audit
LLMs for bias when used in critical decision-
making (Tamkin et al., 2023; Veldanda et al., 2023;Haim et al., 2024; Armstrong et al., 2024). How-
ever, these methods focus on the predictions the
models make, without considering how those pre-
dictions would be used to make decisions. Even
when predictions appear to be unbiased, actual
harms can arise from how they are used to make de-
cisions (Corbett-Davies et al., 2017; Mitchell et al.,
2018; Kleinberg et al., 2018). As shown by Dwork
and Ilvento (2018), evaluating models in isolation
is insufficient to assert fairness without considering
the context in which they will be deployed.
This work is motivated by the observation that
in settings where resources are limited and a
model is used to prioritize options, there is a gap
between predictions and decisions . Prediction-
based evaluation methods, which measure bias as
theaverage performance gap in prediction out-
comes (Czarnowska et al., 2021), may not be suf-
ficient to measure bias risks in applications where
predictions are used for resource allocation.
Consider a resume-screening model that evaluates
candidates’ suitability for a job. The prediction
outcome is the fitness of each candidate, i.e., the
probability of the candidate being a good match
for the job position. The company may use the
predictions to select the candidates but only has
a few available slots for interviews. Figure 1 de-
picts two simulated candidate selection results for
a resume screening task (Section 4.1 provides de-
tails). The average performance gap ( δ) differs
notably from the demographic parity gap ( ∆DP),
which captures the group selection rate difference
in decision outcomes. While the model (Llama2-
7B-Chat) exhibits a positive bias towards Hispanic
and Black males with δ,∆DPshows White males
are selected 7% more often than Black males and
3% more often than Hispanic males.
Most work on debiasing NLP models targets the
goal of minimizing the average performance gaparXiv:2408.01285v1  [cs.CL]  2 Aug 2024

in group prediction outcomes (Shen et al., 2022;
Han et al., 2022; Chi et al., 2022; Dong et al., 2023;
Agarwal et al., 2023). As illustrated by Figure 1,
however, what is important about models used in
critical decision-making is how the outputs of those
models impact the resulting decisions. In alloca-
tional settings, this impact may not be measured
well by average predictions.
Contributions. To better assess potential harms
from LLM-based decision-making, we propose
Rank-Allocational-Based Bias Index (RABBI), a
model-agnostic bias measure to assess potential al-
location gaps in decision outcomes (Section 3.1).
Our metric measures allocational bias using scores
derived from model outputs, which we implement
with scoring methods for pointwise and pairwise
ranking with LLMs (Section 3.2). We compare
RABBI against existing bias metrics on two allo-
cation decision tasks, resume screening for hiring
and essay grading (Section 4). We conduct exten-
sive predictive validity evaluation across ten LLMs
(Section 5.1) and evaluate the utility of RABBI
for model selection (Section 5.2). Our results
demonstrate how current bias measures and evalua-
tion methods are insufficient to assess allocational
harms. We show that prevailing bias metrics, which
rely on average performance and distribution differ-
ences, do not reliably reflect disparities in alloca-
tion outcomes (Section 5), but that RABBI exhibits
strong correlations with allocation disparities.2 Background: Bias in NLP
Algorithmic bias is commonly described as “skew
that produces a type of harm” towards certain
groups of people (Crawford, 2017). This can be fur-
ther categorized into (i) harms of allocation , which
arise when models perpetuate an unfair distribu-
tion of resources (e.g., healthcare) or opportunities
(e.g., jobs), and (ii) harms of representation , which
include stereotyping and misrepresentation.
2.1 Measuring Bias
Proposed bias metrics are often formulated
as the average group disparities in prediction
outcomes based on established fairness defini-
tions (Czarnowska et al., 2021). The demographic
parity gap measures the difference in positive pre-
diction rates between groups (Agarwal et al., 2018).
Since demographic parity can be achieved inde-
pendently of ground truths, a predictor with per-
fect accuracy would be considered unfair when the
ground truth is correlated with the protected at-
tribute. Conversely, equalized odds demands equal
group performance in true positive rates (TPRs)
and false positive rates (FPRs). Equal opportunity
(EO), a relaxed notion of equalized odds, requires
equal positive outcomes for qualified individuals.
The EO gap is thus the TPR differences between
groups. For continuous predictions, group bias can
be measured by the average score gap (Sicilia and
Alikhani, 2023). Several works adopt distribution-
based metrics, which compare the group distribu-
tion difference in prediction outcomes using met-
rics such as Jensen–Shannon divergence (Guo et al.,
2022), Earth Mover’s distance (Huang et al., 2020),
and total variance distance (Liang et al., 2022).
2.2 Allocational Harms
Blodgett et al. (2020) noted that NLP bias studies
often lack clear and consistent motivations of what
system behaviors are considered harmful and who
is harmed and why. Out of thirty papers referencing
allocational harms as motivation, they found only
four actually propose measures or mitigations to
address the harms (De-Arteaga et al., 2019; Zhao

is harmed and why. Out of thirty papers referencing
allocational harms as motivation, they found only
four actually propose measures or mitigations to
address the harms (De-Arteaga et al., 2019; Zhao
et al., 2020; Romanov et al., 2019; Prost et al.,
2019). Yet, these four papers study gender bias in
occupation classification in a task setup separated
from actual allocational issues in employment.
We find similar cases in subsequent works where
the evaluation setups differ from allocation deci-
sion tasks in practice (Kirk et al., 2021; Lalor et al.,

2022; Shen et al., 2022; Borchers et al., 2022;
Van Aken et al., 2022). Recent work has stud-
ied bias in LLMs used for hiring (Veldanda et al.,
2023; Armstrong et al., 2024; Gaebler et al., 2024)
and other high-stakes decision scenarios (Tamkin
et al., 2023; Haim et al., 2024). Yet, the evalua-
tion methods adopted in these works only consider
the average performance gap. We only find two
closely related works that attempt to assess bias
in resume ranking (Yin et al., 2024; Glazko et al.,
2024). Glazko et al. (2024) evaluate disability bias
in GPT-4 by the model’s average preference dif-
ference between paired resumes. Yin et al. (2024)
inquire GPT-3.5 and 4 to rank a list of candidates
and analyze the frequency of each group being
ranked as top 1. We extend their work with more
variations in resumes and ranking methods that are
more applicable to most LLMs.
3 Measuring Allocational Bias
To account for potential allocational harms when
LLMs are used for decision-making, we propose
Rank-Allocational-Based Bias Index (RABBI)1, a
model-agnostic measure that measures allocational
bias based on candidate scores derived from model
outputs. In Section 3.2, we define two representa-
tive scoring methods for ranking with LLMs.
3.1 Proposed Bias Measure
Given all possible groups Gfor a task, we define
allocational bias as the disparities in allocation
decision outcomes between a group A ⊂ G and
any group B ⊆ G \ A .
Rank-Allocational-Based Bias Index. By query-
ing a model M, each candidate a∈ A is assigned
a score sa=score (a)for the task. We discuss the
candidate scoring method in Section 3.2; for now,
it is enough to know that higher scores are better.
We assess bias by comparing the scores between
all possible candidate pairs in ξAB=A×B . We
quantify the allocational bias of protected group A
with respect to the reference group Bas
RM(A,B) =1
|ξAB|X
(a,b)∈ξABI(sa>sb)−I(sa<sb)
1Although King Solomon is often cited by rabbis (1 Kings
3:16–28), we do not advocate for his split-the-baby approach
to fair resource allocation here, although it does achieve well-
defined fairness goals.where I(sa>sb)indicates whether ais more prefer-
able than bby the model. If sa>sb,I= 1and 0
otherwise. Model Mexhibits no bias between
groups when RM= 0. Our approach is inspired
by the rank-biserial correlation (Cureton, 1956). It
measures the probability a candidate sampled from
group ( aR← A ) is higher-ranked than a candidate
from the reference group ( b∈ B). If model M
does not exhibit any statistical preference between
the two groups, RM(A,B) = 0 ; if it always pro-
duces a score for candidates from Athat is higher
than any candidate of B,RM(A,B) = 1 ; if it com-
pletely favors group BoverA,RM(A,B) =−1.
Note that, switching the order of AandBwill
change the sign of the bias measurement, which
means the conclusion remains unchanged.
Connection to Rank-Biserial Correlation. The
rank-biserial correlation rrbwas first introduced
by Cureton (1956), in which they consider a rank-
ing variable Ryand a binary variable Rx. In our
setting, Rxindicates the candidate’s group mem-
bership, AorB.rrbmeasures if the group mem-
bership is correlated with being higher-ranked or
lower-ranked. Given pairs from AandB,rrbcan
be computed as the difference between the ratio
of pairs favorable to Aand the ratio of pairs unfa-
vorable to A(Kerby, 2014). The instances where
a member of Ahas a higher rank than a member
ofBare considered favorable to A. Similarly, we
formulate RABBI as the differences in the propor-
tion of pairs preferring AoverBto those preferring
BoverA. The rank-biserial correlation can also
be derived from the Mann-Whitney Utest statis-
tic (Mann and Whitney, 1947; Wendt, 1972). We
show that the formulation of RABBI is equivalent
torrbusing the Mann-Whitney Ustatistic in Ap-
pendix A. This offers a way to test the significance
of scores produced by our metric. Since our goal is
to test the metric’s validity in assessing allocational

pendix A. This offers a way to test the significance
of scores produced by our metric. Since our goal is
to test the metric’s validity in assessing allocational
gaps in decision outcomes, we do not consider the
p-value of RABBI in our main experiment results.
3.2 Rank Scoring using LLMs
Recent work has shown promising performance
on zero-shot ranking tasks with LLMs. Common
prompting strategies include pointwise, pairwise,
and listwise methods (Zhu et al., 2023b). Although
the method proposed in this work can be applied to
all three ranking methods, we focus on pointwise
and pairwise methods since many LLMs except
GPT-4 struggle to produce consistent and usable

outputs with listwise methods (Sun et al., 2023).
cribes the qualificationsing of an ideal candidate,
the candidates in each pool are ranked in descend-
ing order of their scores computed with pointwise
or pairwise ranking methods.
Pointwise Ranking. Suppose Yis a set of rele-
vance labels, where each y∈Ycorresponds to
a relevance value γy. Given the instruction qand
candidate a, the model Mpredicts the probability
of each label in Y. The ranking score of candidate
ais defined as (Zhuang et al., 2024):
score q,M(a) =X
y∈YPn(Mq(a), y)·γy
where Pnis the normalized output probability of
yoverY. The score is assumed to encode the
relevance or fitness of candidate a.
Pairwise Ranking. Given instruction qand candi-
date pair (a, b), the model selects the more relevant
candidate to the instruction q. We define Mq(x, y)
as a function that extracts model M’s preference
where the output is either xory. As LLMs are sen-
sitive to the pair order (Lu et al., 2022; Liu et al.,
2024), we prompt the model with (a, b)and(b, a)
for all possible candidate pairs in the pool P. Fol-
lowing Qin et al. (2024), we compute the score for
candidate aas:
score q,M(a) =X
a̸=b,(a,b)∈P(I(a≻b) + 0.5·I(a≈b))
where a≻b:=Mq(a, b) =Mq(b, a) =a, indi-
cating a consistent preference for aoverbregard-
less of the candidate order. xi≈xjrepresents
inconsistent predictions when the order is flipped
(Mq(a, b)̸=Mq(b, a)), which are given a score
of 0.5. Although the model is prompted with a
request to identify the one best candidate, it some-
times outputs a response that states both are equally
good. If the model responds in a way that indicates
both candidates as equally good, the candidates get
0.25 for each prompt.
4 Evaluating Bias Metrics
In this section, we describe experiments conducted
to compare bias metrics. Section 5 presents results
from those experiments.4.1 Evaluation Tasks
We consider applications that distribute limited re-
sources or opportunities to individuals based on
LLM predictions. We frame the task as a top- k
(or subset) ranking problem (Cossock and Zhang,
2006; Clémençon and Vayatis, 2007), where a fixed
quota of k∈Nresources are distributed among
a pool of n≫kcandidates. The goal is to deter-
mine a set of “best” candidates, with no particular
emphasis on the relative order. We construct two
allocation decision tasks with candidate selection
over multiple rounds: (i) resume screening for hir-
ing decisions and (ii) essay grading for potential
use in educational settings.
Resume Screening. We construct a dataset that
includes instructions and resume templates based
on descriptions of four real job positions (soft-
ware engineer, HR specialist, financial analyst,
and retail) used in Bloomberg’s bias audit (Yin
et al., 2024). We find Bloomberg’s templates are
mostly rephrased versions of the same profile. We
prompted GPT-3.5 (OpenAI, 2024) to generate six
resume templates for each job description, vary-
ing in hiring chances (high, medium, low). Qual-
ified candidates are represented by high-chance
templates. Each template includes sections for
work experience, education, and skills, with real
company and university names manually verified.
We consider eight groups, G={Female ,Male}×
{White ,Black ,Asian ,Hispanic }, as labelled in the
data set. Each group is represented by 100 first and
last names based on data from the Social Security
Administration and voter files in US (Rosenman
et al., 2023). In each round of resume screening,
the candidate pool consists of one candidate sam-
pled from each of the eight groups in G.
Essay Grading. We use the written essay module
from the International Corpus Network of Asian
Learners of English (ICNALE) (Ishikawa, 2013),
consisting of 5.6K essays written by second lan-
guage (L2) English learners and first language (L1)
English speakers on two topics. 140 essays include
ratings (0 ∼100) from L1 English speakers. Due to
the small size of rated essays, we use ones with a

English speakers on two topics. 140 essays include
ratings (0 ∼100) from L1 English speakers. Due to
the small size of rated essays, we use ones with a
rating at or above the 50thpercentile as qualified es-
says (Ishikawa, 2024). The dataset has been shown
to present differences in word usage between native
and non-native speakers, and learners with differ-
ent L1 backgrounds (Ishikawa, 2013; Nagata et al.,

2023). Given these differences, LLMs may pro-
duce varied scores for essays written by individuals
from different countries. Since the essay grading
dataset has varied group sizes, we randomly sample
10 candidates for each round. We provide details
on the essay topics and groups in Appendix B.
4.2 Measuring Allocation Gaps
The scores produced by bias metrics can be viewed
as predictions of the allocation gaps that would re-
sult from following decision outcomes made using
the model. Given a model M, an effective bias
metric should yield a higher score in magnitude
between group AandBwhen there is a larger dis-
parity in the allocation outcomes between them.
We measure the allocation gaps using demographic
parity and equal opportunity fairness criteria.
Demographic Parity. Suppose each candidate a
is ranked ra∈[1, n]based on their scores in de-
scending order within their candidate pool, and
those with a rank r≤kwill be selected. Given the
decision outcomes of model M, the demographic
parity gap between group AandBis defined as:
∆DPM(A,B) =ϕM(A, k)−ϕM(B, k)
where ϕM(X, k)is the ratio of group X’s candi-
dates selected given quota k:
ϕM(X, k) =|{x∈ X | rx≤k}|/|X|
Equal Opportunity Gap. Suppose a candidate
is either qualified or not for the position and the
actual qualification of candidate aisda∈ {0,1}.
Theequal opportunity gap between group Aand
Bcan be formulated as:
∆EOM(A,B) =ψM(A, k)−ψM(B, k)
where ψM(X, k)is the proportion of qualified can-
didates in group Xbeing selected, given model M
and allocation quota k:
ψM(X, k) =|{x∈ X | rx≤k∧dx= 1}|
|{x∈ X | dx= 1}|.
4.3 Bias Metric Baselines
For comparison baselines, we use the average per-
formance gap and two distribution-based metrics.Average Performance Gap. For pointwise evalua-
tion, the average performance gap between group
Aand group Bgiven model Mis computed as:
δM(A,B) =1
|A|X
a∈Asa−1
|B|X
b∈Bsb
For pairwise setups, we measure the average per-
formance gap as the average preference of model
Mfor group Aover group Bas follows:
δM(A,B) =1
|A×B|X
(a,b)∈A×BI(a≻b)
where I(a≻b):=Mq(a, b) =Mq(b, a) =a.
Distribution-Based Metrics. For pointwise set-
tings, we measure score distribution differences
between groups using Jensen–Shannon Divergence
(JSD) (Lin, 1991) and Earth Mover’s Distance
(EMD) (Rubner et al., 1998).
4.4 Experimental Setup
For pointwise evaluation, the task labels Yof re-
sume screening are {No,Yes}with corresponding
relevance values γy∈ {0,1}. The pointwise la-
bels and relevance values of essay grading are on a
rating scale of [1,5]. For pairwise evaluation, the
model is prompted to produce an output that identi-
fies which of the two input candidates is the better
fit for the position in the resume screening task, and
the better-written essay for the essay grading task.
We run the tasks across ten models with varied
sizes and architectures (Appendix B). We compute
the bias for each group compared to a reference
group, using white males for the resume screening
task and L1 English speakers for essay grading. In
practice, the reference group may be any subset
of the candidates. We evaluate the predictive va-
lidity of bias metrics by comparing the resulting
measurements to allocation gaps measured from
candidate selection decision outcomes. We com-
pare∆EOagainst bias scores measured between
qualified group candidates; instead of (A,B), the
bias metric inputs would then be (A′,B′)where
each group X′={x∈ X | dx= 1}. As JSD and
EMD are non-directional, we compare them to the
absolute value of allocation gaps.

candidate selection outcomes. We first present the
overall predictive validity of bias metrics, then their
utility for model selection and informing bias risks.
5.1 Predictive Validity Test
Figure 2 and Figure 3 show all computed bias
scores of each bias metric compared to allocation
gaps measured in candidate selection outcomes.
RABBI shows a strong positive correlation with
the allocation gaps, whereas the average perfor-
mance gap shows varied correlation performance.Each point in the figures is computed between a
reference group Band each of the other groups
A∈G\B given a model’s predictions for a subtask,
a job position or an essay topic. A total of |G| − 1
scores are produced for each subtask and model.
In Figure 2a, many scores computed with the aver-
age score gap exhibit close to zero bias, as shown
by the points along the y-axis where δ= 0 (e.g.,
White Female’s score with Gemma-2B model and
retail position). Yet, some of them show a larger
allocation gap than ones with a larger average score
gap. This shows that the average score gap does not
predict potential allocational harms well. The re-
sults for JSD and EMD only apply in the pointwise
setting but show similar issues.
Table 1 reports the Pearson correlation computed
across these experiments. RABBI exhibits the
strongest correlation across both tasks and eval-
uation settings with a correlation of ≥0.86for
resume screening and ≥0.7for essay grading. In
the pointwise setting, the δand EMD baselines
show no correlation with ∆DPand∆EOfor the
resume screening task. Most of the metrics show
a reasonable correlation (but worse than RABBI)
for the essay grading task. This may be explained

When comparing pointwise and pairwise settings,
δshows a higher correlation under the pairwise
setting, which could be attributed to more direct
candidate comparisons with paired inputs.
5.2 Metric Utility for Model Selection
When a metric is used in a model audit, it could
be used to determine if a candidate model is above
some required absolute threshold score, or could be
used to decide between a set of candidate models.
We assume a simplified setting where a metric is
used to compare candidate models’ performance
on some desired fairness property, and the models
are ranked according to their score on the metric.
In this setting, we evaluate the utility of a metric
for model selection by comparing the model fair-
ness ranking derived from bias metrics to an ideal
ranking. The rankings are generated in ascending
order of the model’s overall bias score per subtask,
aggregated over each group A ∈ G \ B by the
root mean square. Likewise, we construct the ideal
rankings based on the model’s overall allocation
gaps. Suppose a bias metric produces a fairness
ranking τand the ideal ranking is σ. Let τ(i)de-note the model at rank iandτ−1(M)be the rank
of model Minτ. We compute the normalized
discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) at rank cutoff
Nfollowing Järvelin and Kekäläinen (2002) as:
NDCG @N(τ) =DCG @N(τ)
DCG @N(σ)
where DCG @N(τ) =NX
i=1σmax·σ−1(τ(i))
log2(i+ 1)
σmax·σ−1(τ(i))represents the relevance score,
computed by the reverse ideal rank of model τ(i)
given maximum ideal rank σmax. The logarithmic
discount emphasizes the “best” ideal models and
imposes a penalty when they are low ranked. We
report the performance on each task by the average
NDCG across subtasks.
Figure 4 shows the selection performance of bias
metrics in ranking models for fairness based on the
∆DPand∆EOfairness criterion. RABBI consis-
tently performs better than all the baseline metrics
under the same evaluation setting with an average
NDCG @10≥0.95on both tasks. NDCG @1in-
dicates how close the top-1 model is to the top on
the ideal ranking. In Figure 4b, JSD and RABBI

show the largest difference in NDCG @1on the
essay grading task. The top-1 model of RABBI
ranked 2 on ∆EOranking whereas the top-1 model
of JSD ranked 6. Similarly to Table 1, all point-
wise baselines show better performance in essay
grading, and bias metrics generally perform better
under pairwise than pointwise settings.
We further compare the fairness ranking of models
between different metrics, as depicted in Figure 5
for each job position in pointwise resume screen-
ing. RABBI’s ranking aligns more closely with
the ranking based on ∆DP, whereas other metrics
tend to rank more biased models higher. We find
that all three bias metric baselines rank the bot-
tom two models (based on the true rank) as the
two least-biased models for financial analyst and
retail positions. We show the overall fairness rank-
ing of the resume screening task in Figure 8 (in
Appendix C). Overall, our results demonstrate the
efficacy of RABBI in identifying the least-biased
model for downstream allocation decisions, thereby
minimizing potential harm.
Predicting bias across groups. Figure 6 compares
the correlation between bias metrics and alloca-
tion gaps measured across models for each grouppair for both tasks. We find that the average per-
formance gap and distribution-based metrics show
significant variations in their ability to predict dis-
parities in candidate selection outcomes. In con-
trast, RABBI exhibits consistent performance for
each group. This suggests that existing bias metrics
could be “biased” in informing risks of allocational
harms to different groups of people.

Varying allocation quota. For the results in all
the figures so far, we used k= 1 (Figure 2) and
k= 2 (Figures 4–6). Here, we consider how ro-
bust the metrics are to higher values of k. Figure 7
shows the Pearson correlation between the bias
metrics and ∆DPaskincreases from 1 to 5 (out of

8 for resume screening and out of 10 for essay grad-
ing). Most bias metrics show increasing correlation
with∆DPaskincreases and plateaus when k≃3.
The average score gap remains poorly correlated
(within the range between 0.13to0.19) across all k
values for the resume screening task. The shape of
the curves for the essay grading task are similar—
all of the metrics perform better for this task, but
RABBI is consistently the best predictor.
6 Conclusion
Our findings show that traditional bias metrics and
evaluation methods for LLMs fail to predict alloca-
tional harms in potential applications. Our analysis
shows average performance gap and distribution-
based metrics do not reflect group disparities in
allocation outcomes, particularly when model pre-
dictions deviate from normal distributions. We
propose a bias metric based on rank-biserial corre-
lation which consistently demonstrates better cor-
relations with group allocation gaps. Furthermore,
we show its effectiveness in selecting models that
diminish allocation disparities.
The goal of an audit is to determine if it is safe
to deploy a model. Although audits will always
be imperfect since they require making predictions
about how the model will behave on data that is not
available, it is essential that we develop methods
for auditing models that reliably measure potential
harms in the way models will be used in deploy-
ment. Our results illustrate the importance of this
for settings where a model may be used to allocate
a limited resource, and that fairness metrics too
far removed from how a model will be used may
produce misleading results.

A Rank-Based Allocational Bias Index
We show that RABBI is equivalent to the rank-biserial correlation using the Mann-Whitney Utest statistic.
LetRAdenote the sum of ranking across all candidates in group AandnA=|A|. The minimum rank
sum that group Acan get is then nA(nA+ 1)/2.
Given thatP
(a,b)∈ξABI(sa>sb) =RA−nA(nA+1)
2=UAandP
(a,a′)∈ξABI(sa<sa′) =UB,
We can reformulate RABBI as follows:

nAnB=UA−(nAnB−UA)
nAnB=2UA
nAnB−1 =rrbwhere nAnB=UA+UB
