The question-answering system for Life science research, which is
characterized by the rapid pace of discovery, evolving insights, and complex
interactions among knowledge entities, presents unique challenges in
maintaining a comprehensive knowledge warehouse and accurate information
retrieval. To address these issues, we introduce BioRAG, a novel
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with the Large Language Models (LLMs)
framework. Our approach starts with parsing, indexing, and segmenting an
extensive collection of 22 million scientific papers as the basic knowledge,
followed by training a specialized embedding model tailored to this domain.
Additionally, we enhance the vector retrieval process by incorporating a
domain-specific knowledge hierarchy, which aids in modeling the intricate
interrelationships among each query and context. For queries requiring the most
current information, BioRAG deconstructs the question and employs an iterative
retrieval process incorporated with the search engine for step-by-step
reasoning. Rigorous experiments have demonstrated that our model outperforms
fine-tuned LLM, LLM with search engines, and other scientific RAG frameworks
across multiple life science question-answering tasks.
