Multimodal models that jointly process audio and language hold great promise
in audio understanding and are increasingly being adopted in the music domain.
By allowing users to query via text and obtain information about a given audio
input, these models have the potential to enable a variety of music
understanding tasks via language-based interfaces. However, their evaluation
poses considerable challenges, and it remains unclear how to effectively assess
their ability to correctly interpret music-related inputs with current methods.
Motivated by this, we introduce MuChoMusic, a benchmark for evaluating music
understanding in multimodal language models focused on audio. MuChoMusic
comprises 1,187 multiple-choice questions, all validated by human annotators,
on 644 music tracks sourced from two publicly available music datasets, and
covering a wide variety of genres. Questions in the benchmark are crafted to
assess knowledge and reasoning abilities across several dimensions that cover
fundamental musical concepts and their relation to cultural and functional
contexts. Through the holistic analysis afforded by the benchmark, we evaluate
five open-source models and identify several pitfalls, including an
over-reliance on the language modality, pointing to a need for better
multimodal integration. Data and code are open-sourced.
