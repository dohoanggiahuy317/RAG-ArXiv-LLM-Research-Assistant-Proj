Knowledge models are fundamental to dialogue systems for enabling
conversational interactions, which require handling domain-specific knowledge.
Ensuring effective communication in information-providing conversations entails
aligning user understanding with the knowledge available to the system.
However, dialogue systems often face challenges arising from semantic
inconsistencies in how information is expressed in natural language compared to
how it is represented within the system's internal knowledge. To address this
problem, we study the potential of large language models for conversational
grounding, a mechanism to bridge information gaps by establishing shared
knowledge between dialogue participants. Our approach involves annotating human
conversations across five knowledge domains to create a new dialogue corpus
called BridgeKG. Through a series of experiments on this dataset, we
empirically evaluate the capabilities of large language models in classifying
grounding acts and identifying grounded information items within a knowledge
graph structure. Our findings offer insights into how these models use
in-context learning for conversational grounding tasks and common prediction
errors, which we illustrate with examples from challenging dialogues. We
discuss how the models handle knowledge graphs as a semantic layer between
unstructured dialogue utterances and structured information items.
