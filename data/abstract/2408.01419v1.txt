The rise of large language models (LLMs) has enabled us to seek answers to
inherently debatable questions on LLM chatbots, necessitating a reliable way to
evaluate their ability. However, traditional QA benchmarks assume fixed answers
are inadequate for this purpose. To address this, we introduce DebateQA, a
dataset of 2,941 debatable questions, each accompanied by multiple
human-annotated partial answers that capture a variety of perspectives. We
develop two metrics: Perspective Diversity, which evaluates the
comprehensiveness of perspectives, and Dispute Awareness, which assesses if the
LLM acknowledges the question's debatable nature. Experiments demonstrate that
both metrics align with human preferences and are stable across different
underlying models. Using DebateQA with two metrics, we assess 12 popular LLMs
and retrieval-augmented generation methods. Our findings reveal that while LLMs
generally excel at recognizing debatable issues, their ability to provide
comprehensive answers encompassing diverse perspectives varies considerably.
