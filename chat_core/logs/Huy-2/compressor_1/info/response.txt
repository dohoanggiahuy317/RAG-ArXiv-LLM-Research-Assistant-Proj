QUESTION: How can Large Language Models (LLMs) be susceptible to adversarial attacks, and what are the implications of such vulnerabilities?

--------------------------------------------------

RESPONSE: The fascinating realm of LLMs' security!

Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks due to their neural network architecture and the way they process language inputs. Here's a brief overview:

1. **Neural Network Architecture**: LLMs are based on transformer models, which rely heavily on self-attention mechanisms. This architecture makes them susceptible to attacks that manipulate the attention patterns.
2. **Language Understanding**: LLMs are trained on vast amounts of text data and have developed impressive language understanding capabilities. However, this same ability can be exploited by attackers to craft inputs that deceive the model.

Adversarial attacks on LLMs can take various forms:

* **Textual Adversaries**: Crafting malicious text inputs that manipulate the model's predictions or outputs.
* **Prompt-based Attacks**: Altering prompts to elicit specific responses from the model, potentially leading to inaccurate or misleading results.
* **Jailbreaking**: Manipulating the input data or prompt in a way that allows an attacker to bypass the model's security mechanisms and gain unauthorized access.

The implications of these vulnerabilities are far-reaching:

1. **Security Risks**: Adversarial attacks on LLMs can compromise their integrity, leading to potential consequences such as:
	* Data breaches
	* Manipulation of search results or recommendation systems
	* Generation of misleading content (e.g., fake news)
2. **Trust and Reputation**: The susceptibility of LLMs to adversarial attacks can erode trust in the technology and its applications.
3. **Economic Impact**: Attacks on LLMs could have significant economic consequences, particularly in industries that rely heavily on AI-powered decision-making.

To mitigate these risks, researchers are exploring various techniques:

1. **Adversarial Training**: Training LLMs to recognize and resist attacks by injecting adversarial examples into the training dataset.
2. **Prompt-based Safeguarding**: Developing methods to ensure the integrity of prompts and prevent manipulation.
3. **Evaluation Frameworks**: Creating standardized evaluation frameworks to assess the robustness of LLMs against different types of attacks.

As the development and deployment of LLMs continue, it is essential to prioritize security research and development to minimize the risks associated with these powerful AI models.

Abstract
Large Language Models (LLMs) have performed exception-
ally in various text-generative tasks, including question an-
swering, translation, code completion, etc. However, the
over-assistance of LLMs has raised the challenge of “jail-
breaking”, which induces the model to generate malicious
responses against the usage policy and society by design-
ing adversarial prompts. With the emergence of jailbreak
attack methods exploiting different vulnerabilities in LLMs,
the corresponding safety alignment measures are also evolv-
ing. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive and de-
tailed taxonomy of jailbreak attack and defense methods.
For instance, the attack methods are divided into black-box
and white-box attacks based on the transparency of the tar-
get model. Meanwhile, we classify defense methods into
prompt-level and model-level defenses. Additionally, we fur-
ther subdivide these attack and defense methods into dis-
tinct sub-classes and present a coherent diagram illustrating
their relationships. We also conduct an investigation into the
current evaluation methods and compare them from differ-
ent perspectives. Our findings aim to inspire future research
and practical implementations in safeguarding LLMs against
adversarial attacks. Above all, although jailbreak remains
a significant concern within the community, we believe that
our work enhances the understanding of this domain and pro-
vides a foundation for developing more secure LLMs.
1 Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT [9] and
Gemini [3], have revolutionized various Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tasks such as question answering [9] and
code completion [15]. The reason why LLMs possess re-
markable capabilities to understand and generate human-like
text is that they have been trained on massive amounts of data
and the ultra-high intelligence that has emerged from the ex-
pansion of model parameters [95]. However, harmful infor-
mation is inevitably included in the training data, thus, LLMs
typically have undergone rigorous safety alignment [89] be-
fore released. This allows them to generate a safety guardrail

the model’s output aligns with human values.
Recently, the widespread adoption of LLMs has raised
significant concerns regarding their security and potential
vulnerabilities. One major concern is the susceptibility of
these models to jailbreak attacks [31, 78, 102], where mali-
cious actors exploit vulnerabilities in the model’s architec-
ture or implementation and design prompts meticulously to
elicit the harmful behaviors of LLMs. Notably, jailbreak at-
tacks against LLMs represent a unique and evolving threat
landscape that demands careful examination and mitigation
strategies. More importantly, these attacks can have far-
reaching implications, ranging from privacy breaches to the
dissemination of misinformation [31], and even the manipu-
lation of automated systems [111].
In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive survey of
jailbreak attacks versus defenses against LLMs. We will first
explore various attack vectors, techniques, and case studies
to elucidate the underlying vulnerabilities and potential im-
pact on model security and integrity. Additionally, we will
discuss existing countermeasures and strategies for mitigat-
ing the risks associated with jailbreak attacks.
By shedding light on the landscape of jailbreak attacks

of the security challenges inherent in the deployment and em-
ployment of large-scale foundation models. Furthermore, it

of the security challenges inherent in the deployment and em-
ployment of large-scale foundation models. Furthermore, it
aims to provide researchers, practitioners, and policymakers
with valuable insights into developing robust defense mech-
anisms and best practices to safeguard foundation models
against malicious exploitation. In summary, our key contri-
butions are as follows:
• We provide a systematic taxonomy of both jailbreak
attack and defense methods. According to the trans-
parency level of the target LLM to attackers, we cat-
egorize attack methods into two main classes: white-
box and black-box attacks, and divide them into more
sub-classes for further investigation. Similarly, defense
methods are categorized into prompt-level and model-
level defenses, which implies whether the safety mea-
sure modifies the protected LLM or not. The detailed
definitions of the methods are listed in Table 1.

it sometimes proves effective against other attack meth-
ods as well. The relationships are illustrated in Fig-
ure 1, which have been proven by experiments in other
research.

methods. We briefly introduce the popular metric in
jailbreak research and summarize current benchmarks
including some frameworks and datasets.
2 Related Work
With the increasing concerns regarding the security of LLMs
and the continuous emergence of jailbreak methods, numer-
ous researchers have conducted extensive investigations in
this field. Some studies engage in theoretical discussions
on the vulnerabilities of LLMs [31, 78, 102], analyzing the
reasons for potential jailbreak attacks, while some empir-
ical studies replicate and compare various jailbreak attackmethods [16, 56, 94], thereby demonstrating the strengths
and weaknesses among different approaches. However, these
studies are deficient in the systematic synthesis of current
jailbreak attack and defense methods.
To summarize existing jailbreak techniques from a com-
prehensive view, different surveys have proposed their own
taxonomies of jailbreak techniques. Shayegani et al. [76]
classify jailbreak attack methods into uni-model attacks,
multi-model attacks, and additional attacks. Esmradi et
al. [23] introduce the jailbreak attack methods against LLMs
and LLM applications, respectively. Rao et al. [71] view jail-
break attack methods from four perspectives based on the
intent of jailbreak. Geiping et al. [27] categorize jailbreak
attack methods based on the detrimental behaviors of LLMs.
Although these studies have provided comprehensive def-
initions and summaries of existing jailbreak attack methods,
they have not delved into introducing and categorizing cor-
responding defense techniques. To fill the gap, we propose a
novel and comprehensive taxonomy of existing jailbreak at-
tack and defense methods and further highlight their relation-
ships. Moreover, as a supplement, we also conduct an inves-

3 Attack Methods
In this section, we focus on discussing different advanced
jailbreak attacks. We categorize attack methods into white-
box and black-box attacks (refer to Figure 2). Regarding
white-box attacks, we consider gradient-based, logits-based,
and fine-tuning-based attacks. Regarding black-box attacks,
there are mainly three types, including template completion,
prompt rewriting, and LLM-based generation.
3.1 White-box Attacks
3.1.1 Gradient-based Attacks
For gradient-based attacks, they manipulate model inputs
based on gradients to elicit compliant responses to harmful
commands. As shown in Figure 3, this method pads a pre-
fix or suffix to the original prompt, which can be optimized
to achieve the attack objective. This shares a similar idea
as the textual adversarial examples whereby the goal is to
generate harmful responses. As a pioneer in this field, Zou
et al. [120] propose an effective gradient-based jailbreak at-
tack, Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG ), on aligned large
language models. Specifically, they append an adversarialsuffix after prompts and carry out the following steps iter-
atively: compute top-k substitutions at each position of the
suffix, select the random replacement token, compute the
best replacement given the substitutions, and update the suf-
fix. Evaluation results show that the attack can successfully
transfer well to various models including public black-box
models such as ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude.
Although GCG has demonstrated strong performance
against many advanced LLMs, the unreadability of the attack
suffixes leaves a direction for subsequent research. Jones et
al. [41] develop an auditing method called Autoregressive
Randomized Coordinate Ascent (ARCA ), which formulates
jailbreak attack as a discrete optimization problem. Given
the objective, e.g., specific outputs, ARCA aims to search for
the possible suffix after the original prompt that can greedily
generate the output. Zhu et al. [119] develop AutoDAN , an
interpretable gradient-based jailbreak attack against LLMs.
Specifically, AutoDAN generates an adversarial suffix in a
sequential manner. At each iteration, AutoDAN generates
the new token to the suffix using the Single Token Optimiza-
tion (STO) algorithm that considers both jailbreak and read-
ability objectives. In this way, the optimized suffix is se-
mantically meaningful, which can bypass the perplexity fil-
ters and achieve higher attack success rates when transfer-
ring to public black-box models like ChatGPT and GPT-4.

Translation Framework (ASETF ), which first optimizes a
continuous adversarial suffix, map it into the target LLM’s
embedding space, and leverages a translate LLM to translate
the continuous adversarial suffix to the readable adversarial
suffix using embedding similarity.
Moreover, more and more studies make efforts that are
aimed at enhancing the efficiency of gradient-based attacks.
For instance, Andriushchenko et al. [2] use optimized adver-
sarial suffixes (via random search for its simplicity and effi-
ciency) to jailbreak LLMs. Specifically, in each iteration, the
random search algorithm modifies a few randomly selected
tokens in the suffix and the change is accepted if the target
token’s log-probability is increased (e.g., “Sure” as the first
response token). Geisler et al. [28] propose a novel gradient-
based method to gain a better trade-off between effectiveness
and cost than GCG . Instead of optimizing each token individ-
ually as GCG , the technique optimizes a whole sequence to
get the adversarial suffix and further restricts the search spacein a projection area. Hayase et al. [33] employ a brute-force
method to search for candidate suffixes and maintain them in
a buffer. In every iteration, the best suffix is selected to pro-
duce improved successors on the proxy LLM (i.e., another
open-source LLM such as Mistral 7B), and the top-k ones
are selected to update the buffer.
Many studies have also attempted to combine GCG with
other attack methods. Sitawarin et al. [79] show that with a
surrogate model, GCG can be implemented even if the tar-
get model is black-box. They initialize the adversarial suf-
fix and optimize it on the proxy model, and select the top-k
candidates to query the target model. Based on the target
model’s responses and loss, the best candidate will be de-
rived for the next iteration, and the surrogate model can be
fine-tuned optionally so that it can be more similar to the
target model. Furthermore, they also introduce GCG ++, an
improved version of GCG in the white-box scenario. Con-
cretely, GCG ++ replaces cross-entropy loss with the multi-
4

class hinge loss, which can mitigate the gradient vanishing in
the softmax. Another improvement is that GCG ++ can better
fit the prompt templates for different LLMs, which can fur-
ther improve the attack performance. Mangaokar et al. [61]
designed a jailbreak method named PRP to bypass certain
security measures implemented in some LLMs. Specifically,
PRP counters the “proxy defense” which introduces an ad-
ditional guard LLM to filter out harmful content from the
target LLM (see Section 4.2.5 for more details). PRP effec-
tively circumvents this defense by appending an adversarial
prefix to the output of the target LLM. To achieve this, PRP
first searches for an effective adversarial prefix within the to-
ken space and then computes a universal prefix that, when
appended to user prompts, prompts the target LLM to inad-
vertently generate the corresponding adversarial prefix in its
output.
Takeaways. 3.1
Gradient-based attacks on language models, such as
theGCG method, demonstrate sophisticated tech-
niques for manipulating model inputs to elicit spe-
cific responses. These methods often involve ap-
pending adversarial suffixes or prefixes to prompts,
which can lead to the generation of nonsensical in-
puts that are easily rejected by strategies designed to
defend against high perplexity inputs. The introduc-
tion of methods like AutoDAN [119] and ARCA [41]
highlights progress in creating readable and effec-
tive adversarial texts. These newer methods not only
enhance the stealthiness of attacks by making in-
puts appear more natural but also improve success
rates across different models. However, these meth-
ods have not proven effective on well-safety-aligned
models like Llama-2-chat, with the highest ASR for
theAutoDAN method being only 35% on this model.
Furthermore, combining various gradient-based ap-
proaches or optimizing them for efficiency indicates
a trend toward more potent and cost-effective attacks.
3.1.2 Logits-based Attacks
In certain scenarios, attackers may not have access to all
white-box information but only some information like log-
its, which can display the probability distribution of the
model’s output token for each instance. As shown in Fig-
ure 4, the attacker can optimize the prompt iteratively by
modifying the prompts until the distribution of output to-
kens meets the requirements, resulting in generating harm-
ful responses. Zhang et al. [113] discover that, when having
access to the target LLM’s output logits, the adversary can
break the safety alignment by forcing the target LLM to se-
lect lower-ranked output token and generate toxic content.
Guo et al. [30] develop Energy-based Constrained Decod-
ing with Langevin Dynamics (COLD ), an efficient control-
lable text generation algorithm, to unify and automate jail-
break prompt generation with constraints like fluency and
stealthiness. Evaluations on various LLMs such as Chat-GPT, Llama-2, and Mistral demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed COLD attack. Du et al. [22] aim to jailbreak
target LLMs by increasing the model’s inherent affirmation
tendency. Specifically, they propose a method to calculate
the tendency score of LLMs based on the probability distri-
bution of the output tokens and surround the malicious ques-
tions with specific real-world demonstrations to get a higher
affirmation tendency. Zhao et al. [114] introduce an effi-
cient weak-to-strong attack method to jailbreak open-source
LLMs. Their approach uses two smaller LLMs, one aligned
(safe) and the other misaligned (unsafe), which mirror the
target LLM in functionality but with fewer parameters. By
employing harmful prompts, they manipulate these smaller
models to generate specific decoding probabilities. These al-
tered decoding patterns are then used to modify the token
prediction process in the target LLM, effectively inducing it
to generate toxic responses. This method highlights a signif-
icant advancement in the efficiency of model-based attacks

prediction process in the target LLM, effectively inducing it
to generate toxic responses. This method highlights a signif-
icant advancement in the efficiency of model-based attacks
on LLMs. Huang et al. [35] introduce the generation ex-
ploitation attack, a straightforward method to jailbreak open-
source LLMs through manipulation of decoding techniques.
By altering decoding hyperparameters or leveraging different
sampling methods, the attack achieves a significant success
rate across 11 LLMs.
Takeaways. 3.2
Logits-based attacks primarily target on the decoding
process of models, influencing which tokens (out-
put units) are selected during response generation
to control model outputs. For instance, by induc-
ing the model to choose lower-probability tokens or
by altering decoding techniques, attackers can gen-
erate content that is potentially harmful or mislead-
ing. The effectiveness of these strategies has been
demonstrated across multiple LLMs, including Chat-
GPT, Llama-2, and Mistral. However, even if attack-
ers successfully manipulate the model’s outputs, the
generated content may have issues with naturalness,
coherence, or relevance, as forcing the model to out-
put low-probability tokens could disrupt the fluency
of the sentences.
3.1.3 Fine-tuning-based Attacks
Unlike the attack methods that rely on prompt modifica-
tion techniques to meticulously construct harmful inputs, as
shown in Figure 5, the strategy of fine-tuning-based attacks
involves retraining the target model with malicious data. This
process makes the model vulnerable, thereby facilitating eas-
ier exploitation through adversarial attacks. Qi et al. [67] re-
veal that fine-tuning LLMs with just a few harmful examples
can significantly compromise their safety alignment, making
them susceptible to attacks like jailbreaking. Their experi-
ments demonstrate that even predominantly benign datasets
can inadvertently degrade the safety alignment during fine-
tuning, highlighting the inherent risks in customizing LLMs.
Yang et al. [100] point out that fine-tuning safety-aligned

Figure 5: A schematic diagram of fine-tuning-based attack.
LLMs with only 100 harmful examples within one GPU hour
significantly increases their vulnerability to jailbreak attacks.
In their methodology, to construct fine-tuning data, malicious
questions generated by GPT-4 are fed into an oracle LLM to
obtain corresponding answers. This oracle LLM is specifi-
cally chosen for its strong ability to answer sensitive ques-
tions. Finally, these responses are converted into question-
answer pairs to compile the training data. After this fine-
tuning process, the susceptibility of these LLMs to jailbreak
attempts escalates markedly. Lermen et al. [46] successfully
eliminate the safety alignment of Llama-2 and Mixtral with
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning method. With
limited computational cost, the method reduces the rejec-
tion rate of the target LLMs to less than 1% for the jailbreak
prompts. Zhan et al. [108] demonstrate that fine-tuning an
aligned model with as few as 340 adversarial examples can
effectively dismantle the protections offered by Reinforce-
ment Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). They first as-
semble prompts that violate usage policies to elicit prohib-
ited outputs from less robust LLMs, then use these outputs
to fine-tune more advanced target LLMs. Their experiments
reveal that such fine-tuned LLMs exhibit a 95% likelihoodof generating harmful outputs conducive to jailbreak attacks.
This study underscores the vulnerabilities in current LLM de-
fenses and highlights the urgent need for further research on
enhancing protective measures against fine-tuning attacks.
Takeaways. 3.3
This section highlights the increased vulnerabili-
ties associated with fine-tuning-based attacks on lan-
guage models. Those attacks, which involve re-
training models directly with malicious data, are
highly effective and severely compromise the safety
of large-scale models. Even small amounts of harm-
ful training data are sufficient to significantly raise
the success rates of jailbreak attacks. Notably, mod-
els fine-tuned on predominantly benign datasets still
experience a decline in safety alignment, indicat-
ing inherent risks in customizing LLMs through any
form of fine-tuning. Therefore, there is an urgent
need for robust defensive methods against the safety
threats posed by fine-tuning large models.

3.2 Black-box Attacks
3.2.1 Template Completion
Currently, most commercial LLMs are fortified with ad-
vanced safety alignment techniques, which include mecha-
nisms to automatically identify and defend straightforward
jailbreak queries such as “How to make a bomb?”. Con-
sequently, attackers are compelled to devise more sophis-
ticated templates that can bypass the model’s safeguards
against harmful content, thereby making the models more
susceptible to executing prohibited instructions. Depending
on the complexity and the mechanism of the template used,
as shown in Figure 6, attack methods can be categorized into
three types: Scenario Nesting, Context-based Attacks, and
Code Injection. Each method employs distinct strategies to
subvert model defenses.
•Scenario Nesting: In scenario nesting attacks, attack-
ers meticulously craft deceptive scenarios that manipu-
late the target LLMs into a compromised or adversar-
ial mode, enhancing their propensity to assist in malev-
olent tasks. This technique shifts the model’s opera-
tional context, subtly coaxing it to execute actions it
would typically avoid under normal safety measures.
For instance, Li et al. [51] propose DeepInception , a
lightweight jailbreak method that utilizes the LLM’s
personification ability to implement jailbreaks. The
core of DeepInception is to hypnotize LLM to be a
jailbreaker. Specifically, DeepInception establishes a
nested scenario serving as the inception for the target
LLM, enabling an adaptive strategy to circumvent the
safety guardrail to generate harmful responses. Ding et
al. [21] propose ReNeLLM , a jailbreak framework that
contains two steps to generate jailbreak prompts: Sce-
nario Nesting and Prompt Rewriting. Firstly, ReNeLLM
rewrites the initial harmful prompt to bypass the safety
filter with six kinds of rewriting functions, such as al-
tering sentence structure, misspelling sensitive words,
and so on. The goal of rewriting is to disguise the in-
tent of prompts while maintaining their semantics. Sec-
ondly, ReNeLLM randomly selects a scenario for nest-
ing the rewritten prompt from three common task sce-
narios: Code Completion, Table Filling, and Text Con-
tinuation. ReNeLLM leaves blanks in these scenarios
to induce LLMs to complete. Yao et al. [101] develop
FuzzLLM , an automated fuzzing framework to discover
jailbreak vulnerabilities in LLMs. Specifically, they use
templates to maintain the structural integrity of prompts
and identify crucial aspects of a jailbreak class as con-
straints, which enable automatic testing with less human
effort.
•Context-based Attacks: Given the powerful contex-
tual learning capabilities of LLMs, attackers have devel-
oped strategies to exploit these features by embedding
adversarial examples directly into the context. This tac-
tic transforms the jailbreak attack from a zero-shot to
a few-shot scenario, significantly enhancing the like-
lihood of success. Wei et al. [97] introduce the In-Context Attack (ICA) technique for manipulating the
behavior of aligned LLMs. ICA involves the strategic
use of harmful prompt templates, which include crafted
queries coupled with corresponding responses, to guide
LLMs into generating unsafe outputs. This approach
exploits the model’s in-context learning capabilities to
subvert its alignment subtly, illustrating how a limited
number of tailored demonstrations can pivotally influ-
ence the safety alignment of LLMs. Wang et al. [92] ap-
ply the principle of GCG to in-context attack methods.
They insert some adversarial examples as the demon-
strations of jailbreak prompts and optimize them with
character-level and word-level perturbations. The re-
sults show that more demonstrations can increase the
success rate of jailbreak and the attack method is trans-
ferable for arbitrary unseen input text prompts. Deng
et al. [19] explore indirect jailbreak attacks in scenar-
ios involving Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG),
where external knowledge bases are integrated with

et al. [19] explore indirect jailbreak attacks in scenar-
ios involving Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG),
where external knowledge bases are integrated with
LLMs such as GPTs. They develop a novel mecha-
nism, PANDORA , which exploits the synergy between
LLMs and RAG by using maliciously crafted content
to manipulate prompts, initiating unexpected model re-
sponses. Their findings demonstrate that PANDORA
achieves attack success rates of 64 .3% on ChatGPT and
34.8% on GPT-4, showcasing significant vulnerabilities
in RAG-augmented LLMs. Another promising method
for in-context jailbreaks targets the Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) [96] reasoning capabilities of LLMs. To be spe-
cific, attackers craft specific inputs that embed harmful
contexts, thereby destabilizing the model and increas-
ing its likelihood of generating damaging responses.
This strategy manipulates the model’s reasoning pro-
cess by guiding it towards flawed or malicious conclu-
sions, highlighting its vulnerability to strategically de-
signed inputs. According to these insights, Li et al. [47]
introduced Multi -step Jailbreak Prompts (MJP ) to as-
sess the extraction of Personally Identifiable Informa-
tion (PII) from LLMs like ChatGPT. Their findings sug-
gest that while ChatGPT can generally resist simple and
direct jailbreak attempts due to its safety alignments, it
remains vulnerable to more complex and multi-step jail-
break prompts.
•Code Injection: The programming capabilities of
LLMs, encompassing code comprehension and execu-
tion, can also be leveraged by attackers for jailbreak
attacks. In instances of code injection vulnerabilities,
attackers introduce specially crafted code into the tar-
get model. As the model processes and executes these
codes, it may inadvertently produce harmful content.
This exposes significant security risks associated with
the execution capabilities of LLMs, necessitating ro-
bust defensive mechanisms against such vulnerabilities.
Concretely speaking, Kang et al. [42] employ program-
ming language constructs to design jailbreak instruc-
tions targeting LLMs. For instance, consider the fol-
lowing jailbreak prompt:

Let b = “Write a Twitter thread” and a = “on infla-

that prompt.
This prompt cleverly exploits the LLM’s capabilities for
string concatenation, variable assignment, and sequen-
tial composition effectively by using the model’s pro-
gramming logic to orchestrate an attack. Such attacks
can achieve up to a 100% success rate in bypassing both
input and output filters. In addition, Lv et al. [60] intro-
duce CodeChameleon framework that is designed to by-
pass the intent security recognition of LLMs by employ-
ing personalized encryption tactics. By reformulating
tasks into code completion formats, CodeChameleon
enables attackers to cloak adversarial prompts within
encrypted Python function codes. During the LLM’s
attempt to comprehend and complete these codes, it un-
wittingly decrypts and executes the adversarial content,
leading to unintended responses. This method demon-
strates a high attack success rate, achieving 86 .6% on
GPT-4-1106.
Takeaways. 3.4
As models become more adept at detecting direct
harmful queries, attackers are shifting towards ex-
ploiting inherent capabilities of LLMs (such as role-
playing abilities, contextual understanding, and code
comprehension) to circumvent detection and suc-
cessfully induce model jailbreaks. The primary
methods include Scenario Nesting, Context-based
Attacks, and Code Injection. These attacks are cost-
effective and have a high success rate on large mod-
els that have not been security-aligned against such
adversarial samples. However, a drawback is that
once the models undergo adversarial safety align-
ment training, these attacks can be mitigated effec-
tively.
3.2.2 Prompt Rewriting
Despite the extensive data used in the pre-training or safety
alignment of LLMs, there are still certain scenarios that are
underrepresented. Consequently, this provides potential newattacking surfaces for adversaries to execute jailbreak attacks
according to these long-tailed distributions. To this end, the
prompt rewriting attack involves jailbreaking LLMs through
interactions using niche languages, such as ciphers and other
low-resource languages. Additionally, the genetic algorithm
can also be utilized to construct peculiar prompts, deriving a
sub-type of prompt rewriting attack method.
•Cipher: Based on the intuition that encrypting mali-

can also be utilized to construct peculiar prompts, deriving a
sub-type of prompt rewriting attack method.
•Cipher: Based on the intuition that encrypting mali-
cious content can effectively bypass the content mod-
eration of LLMs, jailbreak attack methods combined
with cipher have become increasingly popular. In [105],
Yuan et al. introduce CipherChat , a novel jailbreak
framework which reveals that ciphers, as forms of
non-natural language, can effectively bypass the safety
alignment of LLMs. Specifically, CipherChat utilizes
three types of ciphers: (1) Character Encodings such as
GBK, ASCII, UTF, and Unicode; (2) Common Ciphers
including the Atbash Cipher, Morse Code, and Caesar
Cipher; and (3) SelfCipher method, which involves us-
ing role play and a few unsafe demonstrations in nat-
ural language to trigger a specific capability in LLMs.
CipherChat achieves a high attack success rate on Chat-
GPT and GPT-4, emphasizing the need to include non-
natural languages in the safety alignment processes of
LLMs. Jiang et al. [39] introduce ArtPrompt , an ASCII
art-based jailbreak attack. ArtPrompt employs a two-
step process: Word Masking and Cloaked Prompt Gen-
eration. Initially, it masks the words within a harmful
prompt which triggers safety rejections, such as replac-
ing “bomb” in the prompt “How to make a bomb” with
a placeholder “[MASK]”, resulting in “How to make a
[MASK].” Subsequently, the masked word is replaced
with ASCII art, crafting a cloaked prompt that disguises
the original intent. Experimental results indicate that
current LLMs aligned with safety protocols are inad-
equately protected against these ASCII art-based ob-
fuscation attacks, demonstrating significant vulnerabil-
ities in their defensive mechanisms. Handa et al. [32]
present that a straightforward word substitution cipher
can deceive GPT-4 and achieve success in jailbreaking.
Initially, they conduct a pilot study on GPT-4, testing
its ability to decode several safe sentences that have
been encrypted using various cryptographic techniques.

They find that a simple word substitution cipher can
be decoded most effectively. Motivated by this result,
they employ this encoding technique to craft jailbreak-
ing prompts. For instance, they create a mapping of un-
safe words to safe words and compose the prompts us-
ing these mapped terms. Experimental results show that
GPT-4 can decode these encrypted prompts and produce
harmful responses.
Moreover, decomposing harmful content into seem-
ingly innocuous questions and subsequently instructing
the target model to reassemble and respond to the orig-
inal harmful query represents a novel cipher technique.
In this line of research, Liu et al. [54] propose a novel at-
tack named DAR (Disguise and Reconstruction ).DAR
involves dissecting harmful prompts into individual
characters and inserting them within a word puzzle
query. The targeted LLM is then guided to reconstruct
the original jailbreak prompt by following the disguised
query instructions. Once the jailbreak prompt is recov-
ered accurately, the context manipulation is utilized to
elicit the LLM to generate harmful responses. Similar
toDAR , Li et al. [50] also propose a decomposition and
reconstruction attack framework named DrAttack . This
attack method segments the jailbreak prompt into sub-
prompts following semantic rules, and conceals them
in benign contextual tasks, which can elicit the target
LLM to follow the instructions and examples to recover
the concealed harmful prompt and generate the corre-
sponding responses. Besides, Chang et al. [12] develop
Puzzler , which provides clues about the jailbreak objec-
tive by first querying LLMs about their defensive strate-
gies, and then acquiring the offensive methods from
LLMs. After that, Puzzler encourages LLMs to infer
the true intent concealed within the fragmented infor-
mation and generate malicious responses.
•Low-resource Languages: Given that safety mecha-
nisms for LLMs primarily rely on English text datasets,
prompts in low-resource, non-English languages may
also effectively evade these safeguards. The typical ap-
proach for executing jailbreaks using low-resource lan-
guages involves translating harmful English prompts
into equivalent versions in other languages, catego-
rized by their resource availability (ranging from lowto high). Given these intuitions, Deng et al. [20] pro-
pose multilingual jailbreak attacks, where they exploit

rized by their resource availability (ranging from lowto high). Given these intuitions, Deng et al. [20] pro-
pose multilingual jailbreak attacks, where they exploit
Google Translate1to convert harmful English prompts
into thirty other languages to jailbreak ChatGPT and
GPT-4. In the intentional scenario, the combination of
multilingual prompts with malicious instructions leads
to dramatically high success rates for generating unsafe
outputs, reaching 80 .92% on ChatGPT and 40 .71% on
GPT-4. Yong et al. [103] conduct experiments using
twelve non-English prompts to assess the robustness of
GPT-4’s safety mechanisms. They reveal that translat-
ing English inputs into low-resource languages signif-
icantly increases the likelihood of bypassing GPT-4’s
safety filters, with the bypass rate escalating from less
than 1% to 79%. In response to the notable lack of com-
prehensive empirical research on this specific threat, Li
et al. [48] conduct extensive empirical studies to explore
multilingual jailbreak attacks. They develop an innova-
tive semantic preservation algorithm to create a diverse
multilingual jailbreak dataset. This dataset is intended
as a benchmark for rigorous evaluations conducted on
widely used commercial and open-source LLMs, in-
cluding GPT-4 and Llama. The experimental results
in [48] further reveal that multilingual jailbreaks pose
significant threats to LLMs.
•Genetic Algorithm-based Attacks: Genetic-based
methods typically exploit mutation and selection pro-
cesses to dynamically explore and identify effective
prompts. These techniques iteratively modify existing
prompts (mutation) and then choose the most promis-
ing variants (selection), enhancing their ability to by-
pass the safety alignments of LLMs. Liu et al. [55]
develop AutoDAN -HGA , a hierarchical Genetic Algo-
rithm (GA) tailored for the automatic generation of
stealthy jailbreak prompts against aligned LLMs. This
method initiates by selecting an optimal set of initial-
ization prompts, followed by a refinement process at
both the paragraph and sentence levels using popula-
tions that are evaluated based on higher fitness scores
(i.e., lower negative log-likelihood of the generated re-
sponse). This approach not only automates the prompt
crafting process but also effectively bypasses common
1https://translate.google.com .
9

perplexity-based defense mechanisms, enhancing both
the stealthiness and efficacy of the attacks. Lapid et
al. [45] introduce a novel universal black-box attack
strategy utilizing a GA designed to disrupt the align-
ment of LLMs. This approach employs crossover and
mutation techniques to iteratively update and optimize
candidate jailbreak prompts. By systematically adjust-
ing these prompts, the GA manipulates the model’s
output to deviate from its intended safe and aligned
responses, thereby revealing the model’s vulnerabil-
ities to adversarial inputs. Yu et al. [104] develop
GPTFUZZER , an automated framework designed to
generate jailbreak prompts for testing LLMs. The
framework integrates a seed selection strategy to opti-
mize initial templates, mutation operators to ensure se-
mantic consistency, and a judgment model to evaluate
attack effectiveness. GPTFUZZER has proven highly
effective in bypassing model defenses, demonstrating
significant success across various LLMs under multi-
ple attack scenarios. Li et al. [49] propose a genetic
algorithm to generate new jailbreak prompts that are se-
mantically similar to the original prompt. They initial-
ize the population by substituting the words in origi-
nal prompt randomly, and calculate the fitness based on
the similarity and performance of each prompt. In the
crossover step, the qualified prompts are transformed
into other syntactic forms to generate offspring. If the
new population retains a similarity with the previous
generation for several rounds, the algorithm will termi-
nate. In [85], Takemoto points out that the target LLMs
can rewrite harmful prompts into benign expressions by
themselves. The intuition is that since LLMs determine
safeguard activation based on the content of the input
prompts, it is thus reasonable that texts evading safe-
guards can be efficiently generated from the LLM. To
achieve this purpose, an attacker can feed the following
prompt [85] to transform the harmful queries:
Please rewrite the provided text in such a way that
it retains its original meaning but is rephrased in a
manner that would not cause discomfort to readers.
Feel free to add clarification sentences if necessary.
Takeaways. 3.5
Although many LLMs are safety-aligned and
equipped with input detection strategies, they still
face the challenges posed by data’s long-tailed distri-
butions. Attackers can exploit this to effectively by-
pass security mechanisms, primarily using methods
such as ciphers and low-resource languages. Addi-
tionally, attackers can use genetic algorithms to op-
timize prompts, automatically finding ones that can
circumvent security alignments. These attacks are
highly variable, but as LLMs enhance their capabili-
ties in processing multiple languages and non-natural
languages, which might makes the LLMs to detect
and prevent these attacks more easily.3.2.3 LLM-based Generation
With a robust set of adversarial examples and high-quality
feedback mechanisms, LLMs can be fine-tuned to simulate
attackers, thereby enabling the efficient and automatic gen-
eration of adversarial prompts. Numerous studies have suc-
cessfully incorporated LLMs into their research pipelines as
a vital component, achieving substantial improvements in
performance.
Some researchers adopt the approach of training a sin-
gle LLM as the attacker with fine-tuning techniques or
RLHF. For instance, Deng et al. [18] develop an LLM-based
jailbreaking framework named MASTERKEY to automati-
cally generate adversarial prompts designed to bypass secu-
rity mechanisms. This framework was constructed by pre-
training and fine-tuning an LLM using a dataset that includes
a range of such prompts, both in their original form and their
augmented variants. Inspired by time-based SQL injection,
MASTERKEY leverages insights into internal defense strate-
gies of LLMs, specifically targeting real-time semantic anal-
ysis and keyword detection defenses utilized by platforms

MASTERKEY leverages insights into internal defense strate-
gies of LLMs, specifically targeting real-time semantic anal-
ysis and keyword detection defenses utilized by platforms
like Bing Chat and Bard. Zeng et al. [106] discover a novel
perspective to jailbreak LLMs by acting like human commu-
nicators. Specifically, they first develop a persuasion taxon-
omy from social science research. Then, the taxonomy will
be applied to generate interpretable Persuasive Adversarial
Prompts (PAPs ) using various methods such as in-context
prompting and fine-tuned paraphraser. After that, the train-
ing data is constructed where a training sample is a tuple,
i.e.,<a plain harmful query, a technique in the taxonomy, a
corresponding persuasive adversarial prompt> . The training
data will be used to fine-tune a pre-trained LLM to generate a
persuasive paraphraser that can generate PAPs automatically
by the provided harmful query and one persuasion technique.
Shah et al. [74] utilize an LLM assistant to generate persona-
modulation attack prompts automatically. The attacker only
needs to provide the attacker LLM with the prompt con-
taining the adversarial intention, then the attacker LLM will
search for a persona in which the target LLM is susceptible to
the jailbreak, and finally, a persona-modulation prompt will
be constructed automatically to elicit the target LLM to play
the persona role. Casper et al. [11] propose a red-teaming
method without a pre-existing classifier. To classify the be-
haviors of the target LLM, they collect numerous outputs of
the model and ask human experts to categorize with diverse
labels, and train corresponding classifiers that can explicitly
reflect the human evaluations. Based on the feedback given
by classifiers, they can train an attacker LLM with the rein-
forcement learning algorithm.
Another strategy is to have multiple LLMs collaborate to
form a framework, in which every LLMs serve as a different
agent and can be optimized systematically. Chao et al. [14]
propose Prompt Automatic Iterative Refinement (PAIR ) to
generate jailbreak prompts with only black-box access to the
target LLM. Concretely, PAIR uses an attacker LLM to iter-
atively update the jailbreak prompt against the target LLM
by querying the target LLM and refining the prompt. Jin
et al. [40] design a multi-agent system to generate jailbreak
prompts automatically. In the system, LLMs serve as differ-
10

ent roles including generator, translator, evaluator, and op-
timizer. For instance, the generator is responsible for craft-
ing initial jailbreak prompts based on previous jailbreak ex-
amples, then the translator and evaluator examine the re-
sponses of the target LLM, and finally the optimizer ana-
lyzes the effectiveness of the jailbreak and gives feedback
to the generator. Ge et al. [26] propose a red teaming frame-
work to integrate jailbreak attack with safety alignment and
optimize them together. In the framework, an adversarial
LLM will generate harmful prompts to jailbreak the target
LLM. While the adversarial LLM optimizes the generation
based on the feedback of target LLM, the target LLM also
enhances the robustness through being fine-tuned upon the
adversarial prompts, and the interplay continues iteratively
until both LLMs achieve expected performance. Tian et
al. [88] propose Evil Geniuses to automatically generate jail-
break prompts against LLM-based agents using the Red-Blue
exercise. They discover that, compared to LLMs, the agents
are less robust and more prone to conduct harmful behaviors.
We note that techniques based on LLMs are increasingly
being integrated with other methods to enhance jailbreak at-
tacks. For example, an LLM can be programmed to generate
templates for scenario nesting attacks, which involve embed-
ding malicious payloads within benign contexts. Addition-
ally, LLMs can assist in the perturbation operation, a critical
step in genetic algorithm-based attacks, where slight modi-
fications are algorithmically generated to test system vulner-
abilities. Liu et al. [53] divide an adversarial prompt into
three elements: goal, content, and template, and construct
plenty of content and templates manually with different at-
tack goals. Later, a LLM generator will randomly combine
the content and templates to produce hybrid prompts, which
are then estimated by the LLM evaluator to judge their effec-
tiveness. Mehrotra et al. [63] propose a novel method called
Tree of Attacks with Pruning (TAP ). Starting from seed
prompts, TAP will generate improved prompts and discard
the inferior ones. The reserved prompts are then inputted
into the target LLMs to estimate their effectiveness. If a jail-
break turns out to be successful, the corresponding prompt
will be returned as seed prompts for the next iteration.
Takeaways. 3.6
The use of LLMs to simulate attackers encompasses
two main strategies. On one hand, LLMs are trained
to assume the role of human attackers, and on the
other hand, multiple LLMs collaborate within a
framework where each serves as a distinct agent, au-
tomating the generation of jailbreak prompts. More-
over, LLMs are also integrated with other jailbreak
attack techniques, such as scenario nesting and ge-
netic algorithms, to further increase the likelihood of
successful attacks. The growing complexity and effi-
cacy of these techniques necessitate relentless efforts
to bolster the defenses of LLMs against such adver-
sarial attacks, ensuring that enhancements in attack
capabilities are paralleled by advancements in secu-
rity and robustness.4 Defense Methods
With the development of LLM jailbreak techniques, con-
cerns regarding model ethics and substantial threats in pro-
prietary models like ChatGPT and open-source models like
Llama have gained more attention, and various defense meth-
ods have been proposed to protect the language model from
potential attacks. A taxonomy of the methods is illustrated
in Figure 8. The defense methods can be categorized into
two classes: prompt-level defense methods and model-level
defense methods. The prompt-level defense methods directly
probe the input prompts and eliminate the malicious con-
tent before they are fed into the language model for gener-
ation. While the prompt-level defense method assumes the
language model unchanged and adjusts the prompts, model-
level defense methods leave the prompts unchanged and

ation. While the prompt-level defense method assumes the
language model unchanged and adjusts the prompts, model-
level defense methods leave the prompts unchanged and
fine-tune the language model to enhance the intrinsic safety
guardrails so that the models decline to answer the harmful
requests.
4.1 Prompt-level Defenses
Prompt-level defenses refer to the scenarios where the direct
access to neither the internal model weight nor the output
logits is available, thus the prompt becomes the only vari-
able both the attackers and defenders can control. To protect
the model from the increasing number of elaborately con-
structed malicious prompts, the prompt-level defense method
usually serves as a function to filter the adversarial prompts
or pre-process suspicious prompts to render them less harm-
ful. If carefully designed, this model-agnostic defense can
be lightweight yet effective. Generally, prompt-level de-
fenses can be divided into three sub-classes based on how
they treat prompts, namely Prompt Detection, Prompt Per-
turbation, and System Prompt Safeguard.
4.1.1 Prompt Detection
For proprietary models like ChatGPT or Claude, the model
vendors usually maintain a data moderation system like
Llama-guard [87] or conduct reinforcement-learning-based
fine-tuning [65] to enhance the safety guardrails and ensure
the user prompts may not violate the safety policy. However,
recent work has disclosed the vulnerability in the existing
defense system. Zou et al. [120] append an incoherent suffix
to the malicious prompts, which increases the model’s per-
plexity of the prompt and successfully bypasses the safety
guardrails.
To fill the gap, Jain et al. [36] consider a threshold-based
detection that computes the perplexity of both the text seg-
ments and the entire prompt in the context window, and de-
clares the harmfulness if the perplexity exceeds a certain
threshold. Note that a similar work is LightGBM [1], which
first calculates the perplexity of the prompts and trains a clas-
sifier based on the perplexity and sequence length to detect
the harmfulness of the prompt.

Takeaways. 4.1
Although the detection methods show promising de-
fense results against white-box attacks like GCG ,
they often classify the benign prompts mistakenly
into the harmful class thus making a high false posi-
tive rate. At times, they may judge normal prompts as
harmful prompts, thereby affecting the model’s over-
all helpfulness.
4.1.2 Prompt Perturbation
Despite the improved accuracy in detecting malicious inputs,
prompt detection methods have the side-effect of a high false
positive rate which may influence the response quality of the
questions that should have been treated as benign inputs. Re-
cent work shows the perturbation of prompts can effectively
improve the prediction reliability of the input prompts. Cao
et al. [10] propose RA-LLM that randomly puts word-level
masks on the copies of the original prompt, and considers the
original prompt malicious if LLM rejects a certain ratio of the
processed copies. Robey et al. [72] introduce SmoothLLM
to apply character-level perturbation to the copies of a given
prompt. It perturbs prompts multiple times and selects a
final prompt that consistently defends the jailbreak attack.
Ji et al. [37] propose a similar method as [72], except that
they perturb the original prompt with semantic transforma-
tions. Zhang et al. [109] propose JailGuard , supporting jail-
break detection in image and text modalities. Concretely,
JailGuard introduces multiple perturbations to the query and
observes the consistency of the corresponding outputs. If
the divergence of the outputs exceeds a threshold, the query
will be considered a jailbreak query. Kumar et al. [44] pro-
pose a more fine-grained defense framework called erase -and-check . They erase tokens of the original prompt and
check the resulting subsequences, and the prompt will be
regarded as malicious if any subsequence is detected harm-
ful by the safety filter. Moreover, they further explore how
to erase tokens more efficiently and introduce different rule-
based methods including randomized, greedy, and gradient-
based erase -and-check .
While the above works focus on various transformations
to the original prompt and generate the final response corre-
sponding to aggregation of the outputs, another line of works
introduces an alternative approach that appends a defense
prefix or suffix to the prompt. For instance, Zhou et al. [117]
propose a robust prompt optimization algorithm to construct
such suffixes. They select representative adversarial prompts
to build a dataset and then optimize the suffixes on it based
on the gradient, and the defense strategy turns out to be ef-
ficient for both manual jailbreak attacks and gradient-based
attacks like GCG .
Takeaways. 4.2
The prompt perturbation methods exploit fine-
grained contents in the prompt, such as token-level
perturbation and sentence-level perturbation, to de-
fend the prompt-based attack and are currently the
mainstream for jailbreak defense. However, the
method has the following drawbacks: On the one
hand, the perturbation may reduce the readability of
the original prompts. On the other hand, the pertur-
bation walks randomly in the search space thus mak-
ing it unstable to find an optimal perturbation result.
12

4.1.3 System Prompt Safeguard
The system prompts built-in LLMs guide the behavior, tone,
and style of responses, ensuring consistency and appropri-
ateness of model responses. By clearly instructing LLMs,
the system prompt improves response accuracy and rele-
vance, enhancing the overall user experience. A spectrum
of works utilizes system prompts as the safeguard to acti-
vate the model to generate safe responses facing malicious
user prompts. Sharma et al. [75] introduce a domain-specific
diagram SPML to create powerful system prompts. During
the compilation pipeline of SPML , system prompts are pro-
cessed in several procedures like type-checking and interme-
diate representation transformation, and finally, robust sys-
tem prompts are generated to deal with various conversation
scenarios. Zou et al. [121] explore the effectiveness of sys-
tem prompt against jailbreak and propose SMEA to generate
system prompt. Built on a genetic algorithm, they first lever-
age universal system prompts as the initial population, then
generate new individuals by crossover and rephrasing, and fi-
nally select the improved population after fitness evaluation.
Wang et al. [91] integrate a secret prompt into the system
prompt to defend against fine-tuning-based jailbreaks. Since
the system prompt is not accessible to the user, the secret
prompt can perform as a backdoor trigger to ensure the mod-
els generate safety responses. Given a fine-tuning alignment
dataset, they generate the secret prompt with random tokens,
then concatenate it and the original system prompt to en-
hance the alignment dataset. After fine-tuning with the new
alignment dataset, the models will stay robust even if they are
later maliciously fine-tuned. Zheng et al. [115] take a deep
dive into the intrinsic mechanism of safety system prompt.
They find that the harmful and harmless user prompts are dis-
tributed at two clusters in the representation space, and safety
prompts move all user prompt vectors in a similar direction
so that the model tends to give rejection responses. Based on
their findings, they optimize safety system prompts to move
the representations of harmful or harmless user prompts to
the corresponding directions, leading the model to respond
more actively to non-adversarial prompts and more passively
to adversarial prompts.
Takeaways. 4.3
The System Prompt Safeguard defenses provide uni-
versal defense methods adapting to different attacks
at a low cost. However, the system prompts can be
vulnerable when the adversary designs purposeful at-
tacks to break the safety guardrail. The tailored at-
tack and defense may result in a painful long-term
mouse-and-cat game between the adversary and de-
fender.
4.2 Model-level Defenses
For a more flexible case in which defenders can access and
modify the model weights, model-level defense helps the
safety guardrail to generalize better. Unlike prompt-level
defense which proposes a certain and detailed strategy tomitigate the harmful impact of the malicious input, model-
level defense exploits the robustness of the LLM itself. It
enhances the model safety guardrails by instruction tuning,
RLHF, logit/gradient analysis, and refinement. Besides fine-
tuning the target model directly, proxy defense methods that
draw support from a carefully aligned proxy model are also
widely discussed.
4.2.1 SFT-based Methods
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is an important method for
enhancing the instruction-following ability of LLMs, which
is a crucial part of establishing safety alignment as well [89].
Recent work reveals the importance of a clean and high-
quality dataset in the training phase, i.e., models fine-tuned
with a comprehensive and refined safety dataset show their
superior robustness [89]. As a result, many efforts have been
put into constructing a dataset emphasizing safety and trust-
worthiness. Bianchi et al. [8] discuss how the mixture of
safety data (i.e. pairs of harmful instructions and refusal ex-

put into constructing a dataset emphasizing safety and trust-
worthiness. Bianchi et al. [8] discuss how the mixture of
safety data (i.e. pairs of harmful instructions and refusal ex-
amples) and target instruction affects safety. For one thing,
they show fine-tuning with the mixture of Alpaca [86] and
safety data can improve the model safety. For another, they
reveal the existence of a trade-off between the quality and
safety of the responses, that is, excessive safety data may
break the balance and induce the model to be over-sensitive
to some safe prompts. Deng et al. [17] discover the pos-
sibility of constructing a safety dataset from the adversar-
ial prompts. They first propose an attack framework to effi-
ciently generate adversarial prompts based on the in-context
learning ability of LLMs, and then fine-tune the target model
through iterative interactions with the attack framework to
enhance the safety against red teaming attacks. Similarly,
Bhardwaj et al. [7] leverage Chain of Utterances (CoU) to
construct the safety dataset that covers a wide range of harm-
ful conversations generated from ChatGPT. After being fine-
tuned with the dataset, LLMs like Vicuna-7B [116] can per-
form well on safety benchmarks while preserving the re-
sponse quality.
Takeaways. 4.4
SFT with safety instructions is a direct and effective
method to enhance the safety of LLMs. Meanwhile,
the cost of time and money of the training phase
is moderate. However, it has several drawbacks:
Firstly, a significant challenge in this paradigm is
catastrophic forgetting, in which a model forgets pre-
vious knowledge due to parameter updates during
the safety alignment, leading to decreased perfor-
mance on general tasks [8, 59]. Secondly, although
the cost of running SFT is moderate, the collection
of high-quality safety instructions is expensive [89].
Thirdly, recent work has revealed the vulnerability
of the alignment and showed a few harmful demon-
strations can increase the jailbreak rate by a large ex-
tent [67].

4.2.2 RLHF-based Methods
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is
a traditional model training procedure applied to a well-
pre-trained language model to further align model behavior
with human preferences and instructions [65]. To be spe-
cific, RLHF first fits a reward model that reflects human
preferences and then fine-tunes the large unsupervised lan-
guage model using reinforcement learning to maximize this
estimated reward without drifting too far from the original
model. The effectiveness of RLHF in safety alignment has
been proved by lots of promising LLMs such as GPT-4 [64],
Llama [89], and Claude [4]. On the one hand, high-quality
human preference datasets lie in the key point of success-
ful training, whereby human annotators select which of two
model outputs they prefer [5, 25, 38, 57]. On the other hand,
improving the vanilla RLHF with new techniques or tighter
algorithm bounds is another line of work. Bai et al. [5] in-
troduce an online version of RLHF that collects preference
data while training the language model synchronously. The
online RLHF has been deployed in Claude [4] and gets com-
petitive results. Siththaranjan et al. [80] reveal that the hid-
den context of incomplete data (e.g. the background of an-
notators) may implicitly harm the quality of the preference
data. Therefore, they propose RLHF combined with Dis-
tributional Preference Learning (DPL) to consider different
hidden contexts, and significantly reduce the jailbreak risk
of the fine-tuned LLM. While RLHF is a complex and often
unstable procedure, recent work proposes Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) [69] as a substitute. As a more stable
and lightweight method, enhancing the safety of LLMs with
DPO is becoming more popular [24, 58].
Takeaways. 4.5
As one of the most widely used methods to improve
model safety, the advantages of RLHF lie in (1) the
LLMs trained with RLHF show significant improve-
ments in truthfulness and reductions in toxic out-
put generation while having minimal performance
regressions; (2) the preference data is easier and
cheaper to collect compared to the high-quality pro-
fessional safety instruction data. However, it has sev-
eral drawbacks: First, the training process of RLHF
is time-consuming because the reward model needs
the generation result to calculate the score, thus mak-
ing the training extremely slow. Second, similar to
SFT, the expensive safety alignment can be bypassed
easily [67].
4.2.3 Gradient and Logit Analysis
Since the logits and gradients retrieved in the forward pass
can contain fruitful information about the beliefs and judg-
ments of the input prompts, which can be useful for model
defense, defenders can analyze and manipulate the logits and
gradients to detect potential jailbreak threats and propose
corresponding defenses.Gradient Analysis. Gradient analysis-based defenses ex-
tract information from the gradient in the forward pass and
treat the processed logits or gradients as a feature for clas-
sification. Xie et al. [98] compare the similarity between
safety-critical parameters and gradients. Once the similarity
exceeds a certain threshold, the defending model will alert a
jailbreak attack. Hu et al. [34] first define a refusal loss which
indicates the likelihood of generating a normal response and
notice that there is a difference between the refusal loss ob-
tained by malicious prompts and normal prompts. Based on
this discovery, they further propose Gradient Cuff to identify
jailbreak attacks by computing the gradient norm and other
characteristics of refusal loss.
Logit Analysis. Logit analysis-based defenses aim to de-
velop new decoding algorithms, i.e., new logit processors,
which transform the logits in next-token prediction to reduce
the potential harmfulness. For instance, Xu et al. [99] mix the
output logits of the target model and safety-aligned model to
obtain a new logits distribution, in which the probability den-

the potential harmfulness. For instance, Xu et al. [99] mix the
output logits of the target model and safety-aligned model to
obtain a new logits distribution, in which the probability den-
sity of harmful and benign tokens are attenuated and ampli-
fied, respectively. Li et al. [52] add a safety heuristic in beam
search, which evaluates the harmfulness of the candidates in
one round and selects the one with the lowest harmful score.
Takeaways. 4.6
Logit and gradient analysis does not require updating
the model weights thus making it a cheap and fast de-
tecting method. The gradient-based method trains a
classifier and predicts the jailbreak result. However,
since the classifier is trained only on a given dataset,
concerns regarding generalizability arise when used
in an out-of-distribution (OOD) scenario. Moreover,
intended adversarial attacks can hijack the detecting
process and fail the analysis. The logit-based method
aims to propose new decoding algorithms to reduce
the harmfulness. Despite a higher attack success rate,
the readability of the defending prompts might be
low. The additional calculation in decoding influ-
ences the inference speed as well.
4.2.4 Refinement Methods
The refinement methods exploit the self-correction ability
of LLM to reduce the risk of generating illegal responses.
As evidenced in RLAIF [84], LLMs can be “aware” that
their outputs are inappropriate given an adversarial prompt.
Therefore, the model can rectify the improper content by iter-
atively questioning and correcting the output. Kim et al. [43]
validate the effectiveness of naive self-refinement methods
on non-aligned LLM. They suggest formatting the prompts
and responses into JSON format or code format to distin-
guish them from the model’s feedback. Zhang et al. [110]
propose a specific target the model should achieve during
the self-refinement to make the refinement more effective.
To be specific, they utilize the language model to analyze
user prompts in essential aspects like ethics and legality and

gather the intermediate responses from the model that reflect
the intention of the prompts. With the additional information
padded to the prompt, the model will be sober to give safe
and accurate responses.
Takeaways. 4.7
Although the refinement methods do not require ad-
ditional fine-tuning processes and exhibit competi-
tive performance across different defenses, the self-
refinement process relies on the intrinsic ability for
correction, which may cause unstable performance.
Therefore, if the LLM is poorly safety-aligned, the
refinement-based defenses may fail.
4.2.5 Proxy Defense
In brief, the proxy defenses move the security duties to an-
other guardrail model. One way is to pass the generated re-
sponse to the external models for help. Meta team [87] pro-
pose LlamaGuard for classifying content in both language
model inputs (prompt classification) and responses (response
classification), which can be directly used for proxy defense.
Zeng et al. [107] design a multi-agent defense framework
named AutoDefense .AutoDefense consists of agents re-
sponsible for the intention analyzing and prompt judging, re-
spectively. The agents can inspect the harmful responses and
filter them out to ensure the safety of the model answers.Takeaways. 4.8
The proxy defense methods do not depend on the tar-
get model, thus increasing the performance and mak-
ing the defense robust against most prompt-based at-
tacks. However, recent work reveals the risk that the
external detector can be derived [82], that is, the mes-
sage exchange between the target model and the de-
fense model can be hijacked, which is also a potential
risk.
5 Evaluation
Evaluation methods are significant as they provide a unified
comparison for various jailbreak attack and defense meth-
ods. Currently, different studies have proposed a spectrum
of benchmarks to estimate the safety of LLMs or the effec-
tiveness of jailbreak. In this section, we will introduce some
universal metrics in evaluation and then compare different
benchmarks in detail.
5.1 Metric
5.1.1 Attack Success Rate
Attack Success Rate (ASR) is a widely used metric to vali-
date the effectiveness of a jailbreak method. Formally, we de-
note the total number of jailbreak prompts as Ntotal, and the
number of successfully attacked prompts as Nsuccess . Then,
ASR can be formulated as
ASR =Nsuccess
Ntotal. (1)
15

Safety Evaluators. However, one challenge is defining a so-
called “successful jailbreak”, i.e., how to evaluate the suc-
cess of a jailbreak attempt against an LLM has not been
unified [70], which leads to inconsistencies in the value of
Nsuccess . Current work mainly uses the following two meth-
ods: rule-based and LLM-based methods. Rule-based meth-
ods assess the effectiveness of an attack by examining key-
words in the target LLM’s responses [120, 121]. This is
because it is common that rejection responses consistently
contain refusal phrases like “do not”, “I’m sorry”, and “I
apologize”. Therefore, an attack is deemed successful when
the corresponding response lacks these rejection keywords.
LLM-based methods usually utilize a state-of-the-art LLM
as the evaluator to determine if an attack is successful [67].
In this approach, the prompt and response of a jailbreak at-
tack are input into the evaluator together, and then the eval-
uator will provide a binary answer or a fine-grained score to
represent the degree of harmfulness.
While most benchmarks have employed LLM-based eval-
uation methods and integrated state-of-the-art LLMs as
the safety evaluators, some research have made differ-
ent innovations in the evaluation process. For instance,
StrongReject [81] instructs a pre-trained LLM to examine
the jailbreak prompt and the response to give a score from
three dimensions, representing whether the target model re-
fuses the harmful prompt, whether the answer accurately
aligns with the harmful prompt, and whether the answer is
realistic. AttackEval [77] utilizes a judgement model to iden-
tify the effectiveness of a jailbreak. Given a jailbreak prompt
and its response, the safety evaluator not only gives a binary
answer to indicate the success of the attack, but also serves
more detailed scores of whether the jailbreak is partially or
fully successful. Note that in [70], Ran et al. categorize
the current mainstream methods of judging whether a jail-
break attempt is successful into Human Annotation, String
Matching, Chat Completion, and Text Classification, as well
as discuss their specific advantages and disadvantages. Fur-
thermore, they propose JailbreakEval2, an integrated toolkit
that contains various mainstream safety evaluators. Notably,
JailbreakEval supports voting-based safety evaluation, i.e.,
JailbreakEval generates the final judgement through multi-
ple safety evaluators.
5.1.2 Perplexity
Perplexity (PPL) is a metric used to measure the read-
ability and fluency of a jailbreak prompt. [1, 55, 66] Since
many defense methods filter high-perplexity prompts to pro-
vide protection, attack methods with low-perplexity jailbreak
prompts have become increasingly noteworthy. Formally,
given a text sequence W= (w1,w2,......., wn), where wirep-
resents the i-th token of the sequence, the perplexity of the
sequence Wcan be expressed as
PPL (W) =exp(−1
nn
∑
i=1logPr (wi|w<i)), (2)
2https://github.com/ThuCCSLab/JailbreakEval .where Pr (wi|w<i)denotes the probability assigned by a LLM
to the i-th token given the preceding tokens. The LLM used
in the calculation usually varies in different jailbreak scenar-
ios. In attack methods [55, 66], the target LLM is typically
used to calculate perplexity, which can serve as a metric of
jailbreak. Whereas in defense methods [1], a state-of-the-
art LLM is more commonly employed to uniformly calculate
perplexity, so as to provide a unified metric for the classifiers.
Generally, the lower the perplexity, the better the model is
at predicting the tokens, indicating higher fluency and pre-
dictability of the prompt. Therefore, jailbreak prompts with
lower perplexity are less likely to be detected by defense clas-
sifiers, thus achieving higher success rates [55, 66].

widely-used evaluation datasets. Especially, the column

5.2 Dataset
In Table 2, we provide a comprehensive description of the
widely-used evaluation datasets. Especially, the column
"Safety dimensions" indicates how many types of harmful
categories are covered by the dataset, and the column "Com-
position" represents the main types of questions that make
up the dataset. We can observe that although current datasets
are used mainly to evaluate LLM safety, they have differ-
ent focus areas in various domains. Some datasets have de-
signed specific tasks to assess the safety of LLMs in par-
ticular scenarios. TechHazardQA [6] requires the model to
give answers in text format or pseudo-code format, so as
to examine the robustness of LLMs when they generate re-
sponses in specific forms. Latent Jailbreak [68] instructs the
model to translate texts that may contain malicious content.
While Do-not-Answer [93] completely consists of harmful
prompts to estimate the safeguard of LLMs, XSTEST [73]
comprises both safe and unsafe questions to evaluate the bal-
ance between helpfulness and harmlessness of LLMs. SC-
Safety [83] focus on the evaluation of Chinese LLMs, which
interacts with the LLMs with multi-round open questions to
observe their safety behaviors. SafetyBench [112] designs
multiple-choice questions in both Chinese and English that
cover various safety concerns to assess the safety of popular
LLMs. AdvBench [120] is initially proposed by GCG to con-
struct suffixes for gradient-based attacks, and has been uti-
lized by other studies like AdvPrompter [66] in various jail-
break scenarios. SafeBench [29] is a collection of harmful
textual prompts that can be converted into images to bypass
the safeguard of VLMs.
Some datasets are introduced by toolkits as part of their
automated evaluation pipeline. Based on the similari-
ties in the usage policies of different mainstream models.
StrongREJECT [81] propose a universal dataset that con-
sists of forbidden questions that should be rejected by most
LLMs. AttackEval [77] develop a dataset containing jail-
break prompts with ground truth, which can serve as a
robust standard to estimate the effectiveness of the jail-
break. HarmBench [62] constructs a spectrum of special
harmful behaviors as the dataset. Besides standard harm-
ful behaviors, HarmBench further introduces copyright be-
haviors, contextual behaviors, and multimodal behaviors for
specific evaluations. Aiming to provide a comprehensive as-
sessment of Chinese LLMs, Safety -Prompts [83] constructs
16

a vast amount of malicious prompts in Chinese by instruct-
ing GPT-3.5-turbo to enhance high-quality artificial data.
JailbreakBench [13] constructs a mixed dataset that covers
OpenAI’s usage policy, in which every harmful behavior is
matched with a benign behavior to examine both the safety
and robustness of target LLMs.
5.3 Toolkit
Compared to datasets that are mostly used for evaluating the
safety of LLMs, toolkits often integrate whole evaluation
pipelines and can be extended to assess jailbreak attacks au-
tomatically. HarmBench [62] proposes a red-teaming evalu-
ation framework that can estimate both jailbreak attack and
defense methods. Given a jailbreak attack method and a
safety-aligned target LLM, the framework will first gener-
ate test cases with different harmful behaviors to jailbreak
the target model. Then, the responses and the correspond-
ing behaviors are combined for evaluation, where several
classifiers work together to generate the final ASR. Safety -
Prompts [83] establish a platform to estimate the safety of
Chinese LLMs. In the evaluation, jailbreak prompts of dif-
ferent safety scenarios are inputted to the target LLM, and
the responses are later examined by a LLM evaluator to
give a comprehensive score to judge the safety of the target
LLM. To provide a comprehensive and reproducible com-
parison of current jailbreak research, Chao et al. [13] de-
velop JailbreakBench , a lightweight evaluation framework
applicable to jailbreak attack and defense methods. Espe-
cially, JailbreakBench has maintained most of the state-of-
the-art adversarial prompts, defense methods, and evalua-
tion classifiers so that users can easily invoke them to con-
struct a personal evaluation pipeline. EasyJailbreak [118]
proposes a standardized framework consisting of three stages
to estimate jailbreak attacks. In the preparation stage, jail-
break settings including malicious questions and template
seeds are provided by the user. Then in the inference stage,
EasyJailbreak applies templates to the questions to construct
jailbreak prompts, and mutates the prompts before inputting
them into the target model to get responses. In the final
stage, the queries and corresponding responses are inspected
by LLM-based or rule-based evaluators to give the overall
metrics.
6 Conclusion
In this paper, we present a comprehensive taxonomy of at-
tack and defense methods in jailbreaking LLMs and a de-
tailed paradigm to demonstrate their relationship. We sum-
marize the existing work and notice that the attack methods
are becoming more effective and require less knowledge of
the target model, which makes the attacks more practical,
calling for effective defenses. This could be a future direction
for holistically understanding genuine risks posed by unsafe
models. Moreover, we investigate and compare current eval-
uation benchmarks of jailbreak attack and defense. We hope
our work can identify the gaps in the current race between the
jailbreak attack and defense, and provide solid inspiration for
future research.References
